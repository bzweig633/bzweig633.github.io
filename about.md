I am an art historian and digital humanist working at the intersection of art, history, technology, and design.

For the past 4.5 years I have been working as a digital project coordination leading large digital projects at the National Gallery of Art, including a Wikimedia partnership that contributed 53,000 images to Wikimedia Commons and 120,000 collection records to Wikidata and the launch of the Open Data Program. Before that, I was the Robert H. Smith Postdoctoral Research Associate for Digital Art History at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (the Center), where I developed scholarly digital humanities research projects. 

I am a medievalist by training, and wrote my Ph.D. dissertation on images of suicide (yes...sorry) in medieval art. My dissertation is open access, so if you would to check it out feel free.
